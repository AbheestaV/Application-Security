We are taking the card number from the user. We also are checking user credentials but nowhere are we 
checking if the user and the card number are correctly corresponding. 

An easy solution for this would be to use the same system as a password. Check if the user and the card number are matching.
Even better is, once a user logs in, find the matching card number, and use the card number to reference to the user all the time. 
This way, we are logging in to the user themselves.
