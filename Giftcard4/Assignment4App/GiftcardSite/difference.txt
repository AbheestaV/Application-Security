1. The two types of intents are explicit and implicit.
Explicit intents specify the component/application which is required to satisfy the intent. 
Implicit intents do not specify any component, they declare an action to perform. Another app's component handles this action.

2. Explicit intent is more secure.
Implicit intents can cause the data to be leaked to third party apps since it does not have a set receiver.

3. Explicit

4. Explicit

5. SecondFragment.kt has an error where the explicit intent is not implemented correctly. Thus restricting a user from the activities. ThirdFragment.kt is the correct implementation.


SecondFragment.kt is now modified to implement a proper explicit intent.
