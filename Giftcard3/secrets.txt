This repository has a lot of files. The following are files you will likely be modifying throughout this assignment.

1. GiftcardSite/GiftcardSite/settings.py
2. GiftcardSite/LegacySite/views.py
3. GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml
4. db/Dockerfile
5. db/k8/db-deployment.yaml


#3 and #5 hav a MySql root password listed in plaintext. These are the following lines mentioned.

env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: thisisatestthing. 

The same lines also show up on #5.

Need to make this a secret.

Create a new yaml file with the following contents.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: newsecret
type: Opaque
data:
  MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: dGhpc2lzYXRlc3R0aGluZy4=

Here, the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD is assigned an encoded (base64) version of the password. Now we need to replace the line in #3 to reference this instead of writing it in plaintext.
To do this, we replace the value attribute with these lines

valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: newsecret
                  key: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD

This must be done in both #3 and #5 files.

execute command
kubectl apply -f newsecret.yaml

There is a SECRET_KEY listed in #1. We need to follow to same process for this as well. 
kmgysa#fz+9(z1*=c0ydrjizk*7sthm2ga1z4=^61$cxcq8b$l

Use the following command to create the secret.

kubectl create secret generic set-skey --from-literal=SECRET_KEY="kmgysa#fz+9(z1*=c0ydrjizk*7sthm2ga1z4=^61$cxcq8b$l"

You will need to add this to the django-deploy.yaml file as well with the following lines.

- name: SECRET_KEY
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: set-skey
                  key: SECRET_KEY 

Now add it to the settings.py file with 
SECRET_KEY=os.environ.get('set-skey')

Apply both your yaml files with the kubectl apply -f "yamlfilename.yaml"

delete all pods
kubectl delete pods --all

rebuild
relaunch
